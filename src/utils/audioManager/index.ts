/**
 * NOTE: Howler bug #2 (v 2.0.12). On all browsers, if html5 is true, and if onend event is fired,
 * then onstop also fires. If html5 is false, then the expected behavior is executed (i.e. onend
 * only fires when audio reaches end, and onstop only fires when stop() is invoked).
 *
 * NOTE: Howler bug #3 (v 2.0.12). In rare cases (Windows version? device hardware?), bad
 * performance on IE11.
 *
 * NOTE: iOS Safari has limits on audio played inside of setTimeout callbacks.
 *
 * NOTE: Be mindful of forcing events inside of event handlers, otherwise unexpected results will
 * occur. An example of a previous bug: executing code inside of onend() handler that eventually
 * invokes stop() on that same audio, causing the onstop() handler to also execute. These bugs, when
 * combined with any Howler bugs (see bug #2 above), can create a tangled web of issues.
